Something that I need to keep in mind with relative and absolute links: 

-absolute paths for resources and websites outside the websites
-build consistent pieces, features, and resources that need to be reliable
-relative pages and resources inside of the website.
-relative is better for testing, supporting, and cleaning up code better.
